Here you will get hints about how to make a application and how to build a Project.


Frontend: A React dashboard would fetch live market data and show performance metrics, trade logs, and allow users to configure settings.
Machine Learning Models: Periodically retrain models with new market data for better predictions.
Security: Ensure secure handling of API keys and implement multi-factor authentication.
Cloud Infrastructure: Use cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud) for scalability and real-time data processing.



This application involves complex interactions between machine learning, real-time data, financial API integration, and user management. The provided code snippets show how to structure the key components, but you will need to build out the full functionality and UI based on this skeleton.
